## How to Build a Snowman!
--------
When winter comes with heavy snow, it’s time to get out there and build a snowman! It’s simple to roll up three snowballs, one large, one medium, and one small. Stack them up with the biggest on bottom and the smallest on top for the head. Then let your creative side run wild by decorating the snowman with a face, clothing, arms, and any accessories that you want!

## Instructions

1. Check for snow that’s moist and packable. If your snow is too fluffy or powdery, you will not be able to make a snowman. Go out to the snow and scoop some up between both of your hands. Press it together, and if it forms into a ball, you’ll be able to make a snowman
2. Pack a snowball with your hands for the bottom section. Scoop up a handful of snow with both hands. Pack it together into a round shape. Add snow to the ball in your hands until it is about one foot wide.
3. Roll the ball along the ground to make the bottom section. Set the snowball on the ground and begin rolling it forward. As you roll, avoid making a cylinder by changing the direction you’re rolling the ball. Roll until it become three feet wide.
4. Form the middle section. Scoop up some snow in both hands and pack it into a tight ball. Add more snow until the ball is too heavy to carry. Put it on the ground and roll it around as you did for the bottom section. This time, stop when the ball reaches about two feet wide.
5. Lift the middle section onto the bottom section. Pick it up and gently set it on the bottom section. Make sure that it sits right in the center of the bottom ball.
6. Make a one foot snowball for the head. When you finish, carefully place it on top of the snowman’s body.

## Decorating the Snowman
1. Stick a carrot in the middle of the head for a nose.Make sure you place it so there is room above it for eyes and below it for a mouth.
2. Use buttons, rocks, or charcoal for eyes. Place them above the carrot, and push them into the head. Any round object will work for the eyes.
3. Make a mouth with a row of pebbles or charcoal. Use the same thing you used for the eyes to make the mouth, or mix it up with other round objects. Place the mouth under the nose, but not too close to the middle section.
4. Add two sticks for the snowman’s arms. Find a couple of sticks that are about one inch wide and around three feet long. Push the sticks into the middle section of the snowman. Position the sticks so they are angled up or down, giving the snowman the look you like best.
